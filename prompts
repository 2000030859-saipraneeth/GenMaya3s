You are tasked with creating a basic web application using Flask that functions as a simple addition application. The application should provide an interface for users to input two numbers and perform addition. The result of the addition should be displayed prominently on the page and updated dynamically as the user interacts with the input fields. Additionally, the application should include a clear button to reset the input fields back to their initial state. The application must handle edge cases, such as ensuring that the inputs are valid numbers before performing the addition. Upon each addition operation, the updated result should be reflected immediately without needing to refresh the page. The goal is to create an interactive and user-friendly addition application that provides real-time feedback to users as they input numbers and see the result.

You are tasked with creating a basic web application using Flask that functions as a simple counter application. The application should have buttons for incrementing and decrementing a counter value. The current value of the counter should be displayed prominently on the page and updated dynamically as the user interacts with the buttons. Additionally, a reset button should be included to reset the counter back to zero. The application must handle edge cases, such as preventing the counter from going below zero. Upon each change (increment, decrement, reset), the updated counter value should be reflected immediately without needing to refresh the page. The goal is to create an interactive and user-friendly counter application that provides real-time feedback to users as they adjust the counter value.
